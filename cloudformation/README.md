# CloudFormation Templates

Some of the CloudFormation templates I've created can be [found here](templates).

To deploy these templates, I've used [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [runway](https://docs.onica.com/projects/runway/en/release/) to assign the template's parameter values and deploy the CloudFormation stack.

I've also created many CloudFormation templates using [troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) to convert [blueprints](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprints.html) into CloudFormation templates. Some of my blueprints can be [found here](../troposphere/blueprints).
