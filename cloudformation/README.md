# CloudFormation Templates

There aren't many templates in this directory because I used [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html<Paste>) and [runway](https://docs.onica.com/projects/runway/en/release/) to deploy CloudFormation. 

With these tools, I created many CloudFormation templates using [troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) to create [blueprints](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprints.html) which can be [found here](../stacker/blueprints).
Also, I created many CloudFormation YAML templates which can be [found here](../stacker/templates).
