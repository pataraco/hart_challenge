# CloudFormation Templates (deployed by Stacker)

The CloudFormation templates that `stacker` can use can be [found here](../../cloudformation/templates).

The Troposphere blueprints that create CloudFormation templates that `stacker` can use can be [found here](../../troposphere/blueprints).

[Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) can be used to create CloudFormation templates from [blueprints](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprints.html). 
With these blueprints, you can use [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [runway](https://docs.onica.com/projects/runway/en/release/) to deploy CloudFormation.
