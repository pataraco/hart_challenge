# Stacker

To deploy CloudFormation templates, you can use [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [runway](https://docs.onica.com/projects/runway/en/release/) to assign the template's parameter values and deploy the CloudFormation stack.

I've created many CloudFormation templates using [troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) to convert [blueprints](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprints.html) into CloudFormation templates. Some of my blueprints can be [found here](../troposphere/blueprints). Also, many of my CloudFormation templates can be [found here](../cloudformation/templates).
