# Troposphere

[Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) can be used to create CloudFormation templates from [blueprints](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprints.html). 
With these blueprints, you can use [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [runway](https://docs.onica.com/projects/runway/en/release/) to deploy CloudFormation. 

Some of the blueprints that I've created can be [found here](blueprints).

`stacker` can also be used to deploy native CloudFormation templates. Some of the CloudFormation templates that I've create can be [found here](../cloudformation/templates).
